        HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the cornerstone of web development, defining the structure and content of web pages. It uses tags to mark elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, and images, enabling browsers to interpret and display them as intended. HTML5, the latest version, supports multimedia, form controls, and semantic elements, enhancing accessibility and SEO. Its simplicity and versatility make it fundamental for creating accessible and well-structured websites, while its integration with CSS and JavaScript allows for dynamic and interactive web experiences. As the backbone of the internet, HTML continues to evolve, shaping the way information is presented and accessed online.

    <div class="flex">CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is essential in web programming, governing the visual presentation of HTML elements. It enables developers to define styles like colors, layouts, fonts, and animations, ensuring consistency and aesthetics across web pages. CSS3 introduces advanced features like gradients, transitions, and responsive design capabilities, adapting layouts for various devices seamlessly. By separating content from presentation, CSS streamlines website maintenance and enhances user experience. It integrates with HTML and JavaScript, allowing for dynamic styling based on user interactions. CSS frameworks like Bootstrap further simplify design tasks, fostering efficient and scalable development practices. Overall, CSS empowers developers to create visually appealing and functional web interfaces.

    <div class="flex">JavaScript (JS) is pivotal in web programming, enabling interactive and dynamic functionality on websites. As a client-side scripting language, JS executes in users' browsers, manipulating HTML and CSS to create responsive and engaging interfaces. It facilitates tasks like form validation, animation, and DOM manipulation, enhancing user experience and interactivity. JS frameworks and libraries such as React, Angular, and Vue extend its capabilities, simplifying complex tasks and promoting modular development. With Node.js, JS also powers server-side scripting, enabling full-stack development and real-time applications. Its versatility, coupled with extensive community support and continual evolution, solidifies JS as a cornerstone of modern web programming.</div>
